# Recommendations

After Careful analysis and examination of what the insights suggested, it is important to see what is recommended to better and innovative decisions moving forward:

1. It is expected to see more bookings coming from Portugal than any other country as it accounts for more than 27,000 of the 86,000 bookings made, even if a drop happens, there's a higher chance it'd still lead

2. Most of the bookings made are mostly completed way more than half of the time, lesser expectations should be put on bookings cancellations and preparedness should be tailored offering the best services for completed bookings.

3.  It is very evident that more customers prefer the BB(breakfast and bed) meal option which means it's only breakfast they're booking for. breakfast Menus should be given utmost priority, FB(full board) requests is extremely low and doesn't look like coming up in future bookings, when we compare the ratio between BB and FB 67,000: 353.

4. With the data showing a lion share figure of Transient customers, a majority of the preparations should be for short term stay basis, the Group category of customers are very low in this dataset, which means bookings in the category won't happen frequently like the Transient customers who are only staying for a short period of time.

5. 68,793 bookings were made via travel agencies/ tour operators. This only indicates that most of the customers booking in the hotel are likely to be tourists with more than 27,000 of them booking from portugal. It is recommended  that special package be given to people who are tourists or who booked via a tourism agency platform.
